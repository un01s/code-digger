# code-digger

Code has a hidden universe, and you have to dig it to crack it open. Usually the compiler, the debugger, the OS are kind of black boxes, right?

## write a debugger to understand how debugger works

Tim is writing a debugger in Rust, and he uses [rust-sitter] as a parser. This rust-sitter is based on another project, [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/). This tree-sitter is a tool for generating fast, incremental parsers.
